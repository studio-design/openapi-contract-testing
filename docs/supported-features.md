# Supported features and known limitations

This is a contract-testing tool: where we can't enforce a constraint precisely, we prefer a loud failure or an explicit "skipped" outcome over silently accepting non-compliant data. The list below pins down what does and does not get checked so you can decide whether the gaps matter for your spec.

## OpenAPI 3.0 vs 3.1

The package auto-detects the OAS version from the `openapi` field and handles schema conversion accordingly:

| Feature | 3.0 handling | 3.1 handling |
|---|---|---|
| `nullable: true` | Converted to type array `["string", "null"]`; `null` appended to `enum` if present | Not applicable (uses type arrays natively) |
| `prefixItems` | N/A | Converted to `items` array (Draft 07 tuple) |
| `$dynamicRef` / `$dynamicAnchor` | N/A | Removed (not in Draft 07) |
| `examples` (array) | Removed (Draft 2020-12 keyword, not Draft 07) | Removed (Draft 2020-12 keyword, not Draft 07) |
| `const` | N/A | Lowered to `enum: [value]` so opis Draft 07 enforces it |
| `readOnly` / `writeOnly` | Semantic enforcement (see below). Forbidden properties become boolean `false` subschemas; the keyword is dropped as OAS-only on surviving properties | Semantic enforcement (see below). Forbidden properties become boolean `false` subschemas; the keyword is preserved on surviving properties (valid in Draft 07) |

### `readOnly` / `writeOnly` enforcement

Both validators apply OpenAPI's asymmetric semantics instead of letting the keywords pass as no-ops:

- **Response validation** (`OpenApiResponseValidator`, Laravel trait): any property marked `writeOnly: true` must **not** appear in the response body. If it does, validation fails with the offending property named in the error. A `writeOnly + required` entry is treated as absent on the response side, so a compliant response that omits the property still validates.
- **Request validation** (`OpenApiRequestValidator`): any property marked `readOnly: true` must **not** appear in the request body. `readOnly + required` is treated as absent on the request side, so a compliant request that omits the property still validates.

Detection looks at each property schema's own top-level `readOnly` / `writeOnly`; markers nested inside the property's `allOf` / `oneOf` / `anyOf` children are not enforced in the current release.

## Body validation
- **Validated**: `application/json` and any `+json` structured-syntax suffix (RFC 6838), and content keys using ranges (`application/*`, `*/*`) — the matcher tries exact match first, then `<type>/*`, then `*/*`.
- **Multi-JSON-per-status specs** (e.g. `application/json` + `application/problem+json` for the same status): when the actual response Content-Type is supplied, schema validation prefers the spec key that exactly matches the response Content-Type before falling back to the first JSON key. A problem-details body served as `application/problem+json` is judged against its own schema, not the success-shape `application/json` schema. Vendor `+json` suffixes the spec doesn't enumerate (e.g. `application/vnd.example.v1+json`) still fall through to the first JSON key, preserving the legacy interchangeable-JSON behaviour for that case.
- **Presence-only** (no schema validation): every other media type, including `application/xml`, `multipart/form-data`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `text/plain`, and `application/octet-stream`. The validator confirms the spec declares the content type but does not check the body. When the matched media-type entry declares a `schema` (OpenAPI permits a schema on any media type, but this JSON Schema engine cannot evaluate a non-JSON one), the orchestrator marks the response/request as `Skipped` with a `skipReason` so the unvalidated body is surfaced in coverage rather than counted as a clean pass. A non-JSON entry with no `schema` has nothing to validate and stays a plain success.
- **Multipart `encoding` object**: per-part `contentType` / `headers` / `style` / `explode` are not consulted.
- **Cascading `additionalProperties: false` errors** are stripped automatically. opis's `PropertiesKeyword` skips its `addCheckedProperties()` call whenever any sub-property fails its schema, leaving `$checked` empty in the validation context. The follow-on `additionalProperties: false` keyword then reports every property the data carries — including ones explicitly declared in the schema's `properties` — as "additional". The validator walks opis's `ValidationError` tree, reads the raw list of "additional" property names from `args()['properties']`, and filters out names that ARE declared in the schema's `properties` keyword at that path. A single failure shows as one error, not a paired pseudo-error naming declared properties as not-allowed. Genuine additional properties still surface; mixed cases keep only the real extras in the message. The property-name comparison is fully structural (raw arrays + raw path segments — no string parsing of the rendered message for the names), so property names containing commas, whitespace, empty strings, or JSON-Pointer-escape-worthy characters survive correctly. The walker also descends through `items` for array-element segments, so cascades through `{ data: [Item] }`-shaped envelopes (single-schema items and Draft 07 tuple-form items, including the shape `OpenApiSchemaConverter` lowers OAS 3.1 `prefixItems` to) collapse the same way. The walker recognises only `properties.<name>` and `items` transitions and treats every other shape as unresolvable — composition keywords (`oneOf` / `allOf` / `anyOf`), `additionalProperties: <schema>`, `patternProperties`, `additionalItems`, and boolean schemas at item level all fall through to keeping the original message untouched, so a real additional-property violation is never silently swallowed.

## Parameter styles
- **Query**: only `style: form` + `explode: true` (the OAS default). Specs declaring `pipeDelimited`, `spaceDelimited`, `deepObject`, or `form` + `explode: false` are not parsed; type-mismatch errors will surface but they will point at the wrong cause.
- **Header / Path**: only `style: simple` for scalar values. `type: array` and `type: object` parameters are not parsed (the raw string is fed to the schema, which then mismatches). `style: matrix` and `style: label` for path parameters are not handled — the prefix is not stripped before validation.
- **Cookie parameters** (`apiKey` security scheme aside): not validated.
- **`parameters[].content`**: only `parameters[].schema` is read.

## Security schemes
- **Validated**: `apiKey` (in `header` / `query` / `cookie`) and `http` + `bearer` — presence checks for the named header/query/cookie / RFC 6750 `Bearer` token.
- **Loud `E_USER_WARNING` on first encounter**: `oauth2`, `openIdConnect`, `mutualTLS`, and `http` schemes other than `bearer` (`basic`, `digest`). When every scheme in a security requirement is unsupported the requirement still passes (false-negative avoidance — blocking the test for a spec we cannot evaluate is worse than letting it through), but the validator fires a one-shot per-scheme-name warning so the silent pass does not stay invisible. The warning is emitted as a single line (shown wrapped here for readability):

  ```
  [security] OAuth2 scheme 'oauth2_user' is silently passed (no token check) — POST /v1/users. The opis/json-schema-based validator cannot verify oauth2 / openIdConnect / mutualTLS / http-basic / http-digest credentials. Your test will not detect a missing or invalid token. Workaround: split the bearer-token surface into a separate test, or assert the Authorization header presence manually.
  ```

  Under `phpunit.xml` `failOnWarning="true"` this surfaces as a test failure on first encounter — the recommended setting if your spec contains any of these scheme types, since green tests against unauthenticated requests are the worst-class silent failure for a contract-testing tool.

## Schema features
- **Validated** (delegated to opis Draft 07): `type`, `enum`, `multipleOf`, `minimum`/`maximum`/`exclusiveMinimum`/`exclusiveMaximum`, `minLength`/`maxLength`/`pattern`, `minItems`/`maxItems`/`uniqueItems`, `minProperties`/`maxProperties`/`required`, `additionalProperties` (`true` / `false` / schema), `allOf` / `oneOf` / `anyOf` / `not`.
- **`format`** (validated by opis Draft 06+): the canonical 19-entry set (`email`, `uuid`, `date`, `date-time`, `uri`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `hostname`, `regex`, `json-pointer`, …). The full list is the authoritative `KNOWN_OPIS_FORMATS` constant in `src/Spec/OpenApiSchemaConverter.php` — keeping it in one place avoids drift when opis adds formats. Unknown values (e.g. `format: emial` typo for `email`) emit a one-shot `E_USER_WARNING` per format value, since opis silently accepts any value for unrecognised formats. Non-string `format` values fire a separate malformed-spec warning.
- **Advisory `format`** (deliberately not enforced, no warning): `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `double`, `byte`, `binary`, `password`. Treated as documentation hints per OAS conventions; see `ADVISORY_FORMATS` constant.
- **Lowered**: `const` → `enum: [value]` (3.1); `discriminator` + `mapping` → an `allOf` of `if`/`then` conditionals (default; see `discriminator` below).
- **Stripped**: `xml`, `externalDocs`, `example` / `examples`, `deprecated`, OAS-only `nullable`/`readOnly`/`writeOnly` after enforcement (3.0), and Draft 2020-12 keys `$dynamicRef` / `$dynamicAnchor` / `contentSchema` (3.1). `discriminator` is also stripped when enforcement is turned off (`enforce_discriminator: false`).
- **Validated via opis (Draft 06+)**: `patternProperties`, `contentMediaType`, `contentEncoding`. These are JSON Schema keywords that opis implements natively, so your constraints are enforced.
- **Not supported (loud E_USER_WARNING when first encountered)**: `unevaluatedProperties`, `unevaluatedItems`. These are 2019-09 keywords with no Draft 07 equivalent — opis silently ignores them, so the warning surfaces specs that depend on them. Rewrite using `additionalProperties: false` plus explicit `properties` to enforce object closure.
- **Advisory-only (loud E_USER_WARNING when first encountered)**: `dependentSchemas`, `dependentRequired`. These 2019-09 property-dependency keywords are not registered by opis Draft 07, so the constraint is dropped wholesale — a payload carrying the trigger property without its dependents passes silently. Rewrite as a Draft 07 conditional with `if` / `then` / `else` (the `if` clause tests for the trigger property, the `then` clause carries the dependent requirement).
- **`discriminator`** (enforced by default, #262): when a schema declares `discriminator` with a non-empty `mapping`, the converter lowers it into an `allOf` of an unknown-value guard (the discriminator property must be present and one of the mapping keys) plus one `if`/`then` per mapping value, where `then` is the resolved subtype schema. The discriminator value therefore steers validation toward a single branch — a body that lies about its type (e.g. `kty: RSA` carrying EC-only fields) fails instead of passing the underlying `oneOf` / `anyOf` union. This is stricter than the OAS spec strictly requires (the discriminator is officially a tooling hint), which is exactly what a contract-testing tool wants. No `E_USER_WARNING` is emitted.
  - **Opt out**: set `enforce_discriminator: false` (Laravel config) or `<parameter name="enforce_discriminator" value="false"/>` (the PHPUnit extension; `0` / `no` also work) to restore the historical behaviour — `discriminator` is stripped and the mapping is not enforced (and no warning is emitted).
  - **Malformed blocks**: with enforcement on, a structurally invalid `discriminator` (missing/non-string `propertyName`, non-array `mapping`, non-string mapping value, an unresolvable mapping pointer, or a pointer to a non-object) surfaces as a loud validation failure rather than silently passing.
  - **Known limitation**: a self-referential discriminator chain (a subtype that, via `allOf` + `$ref`, re-contains the *same* base discriminator — the inheritance idiom) is enforced at the first recursion level; the inner re-appearance of that same discriminator is stripped without re-lowering (the outer branch already routes to and enforces that exact subtype). This terminates the lowering and avoids combinatorial blow-up while still enforcing the outer branch selection. Subtype-specific constraints (e.g. `required`) are unaffected — they live in the outer `then`.
  - **`nullable` + `discriminator`** (3.0): a `null` body fails the discriminated-object branch (the lowered guard requires the discriminator property). Model a null-tolerant polymorphic field with an explicit `oneOf` including `{type: 'null'}` if needed.
- **`readOnly` / `writeOnly`**: enforced at the property's own top level only (see [readOnly / writeOnly enforcement](#readonly--writeonly-enforcement)).

## HTTP methods
The PHPUnit coverage report counts `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`. Operations under `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE` are not part of the coverage allowlist, and the Laravel auto-validation hook silently skips them (it normalises the request method through `HttpMethod::tryFrom()`, which returns `null` for these). Direct calls to `OpenApiResponseValidator::validate()` with one of these method strings will resolve against the spec — but if you depend on coverage tracking or the Laravel trait, treat HEAD / OPTIONS / TRACE as out of scope today.

## Spec features not consulted
Webhooks (3.1), Callbacks, Response `Links`, Server URL templating (`servers` with `variables`), Examples (`examples` blocks at parameter / requestBody / response level — not used for fuzzing or validation), `tags`, `externalDocs`, vendor extensions (`x-*` keys, ignored harmlessly).

## Warning channel (`E_USER_WARNING` contract)

The library uses PHP's native `trigger_error(..., E_USER_WARNING)` as the loud-signal channel for silent-pass conditions the validator cannot enforce. **This is the v1.0 official API**: warnings are dedup'd per-process and prefixed with a category tag so callers can route or filter them mechanically.

| Category prefix | Source | Dedup key |
|---|---|---|
| `[security]` | `SecurityValidator` (`oauth2`, `openIdConnect`, `mutualTLS`, `http-basic`, `http-digest`) | scheme name |
| `[OpenAPI Schema]` | `OpenApiSchemaConverter` (`unevaluatedProperties` / `unevaluatedItems`, `dependentSchemas` / `dependentRequired`, unknown / malformed `format`) | per-keyword / per-format-value |

**How to consume:**

- **Default** (PHPUnit `failOnWarning="true"`): the first warning fails the test. Recommended for contract-testing pipelines, since silent-pass on auth or unknown formats is the worst-class failure mode.
- **Stay green, surface warnings in output**: omit `failOnWarning` (PHPUnit 10+ default is `false`). Warnings show in the test report but do not fail.
- **Capture programmatically** (e.g. for a custom report):
  ```php
  set_error_handler(static function (int $errno, string $errstr): bool {
      if ($errno === E_USER_WARNING && str_starts_with($errstr, '[security]')) {
          MyReport::record($errstr);
          return true; // suppress
      }
      return false; // bubble
  });
  ```
- **Suppress one category** (e.g. acknowledged limitation): match on the category prefix in your error handler. Do not blanket-suppress all `E_USER_WARNING`s — unrelated warnings would silently disappear.

**Why not exceptions / PSR-3 logger / structured payload on `OpenApiValidationResult`?** The simple channel is zero-dep, integrates with every PHP framework's existing error handler, and stays out of the v1.0 SemVer surface. A structured channel (`WarningCollector`, PSR-3 sink, or `result->warnings()`) can be added in v1.x as additive without breaking — we are deliberately deferring until real-world usage demands it. See [issue #149](https://github.com/studio-design/openapi-contract-testing/issues/149) for the design discussion.

**Per-process dedup vs per-test:** the dedup state is process-global. PHPUnit runs all tests in one process by default, so a warning fired in test A is not fired again in test B even if both schemas exhibit the issue. The `*::resetWarningStateForTesting()` helpers (annotated `@internal`) exist as test seams for the converter / security validator's own tests; downstream tests rarely need them.
