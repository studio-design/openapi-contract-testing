/**
 * Thrown by {@see OpenApiCoverageExtension}
 * when a `min_endpoint_coverage` / `min_response_coverage` parameter is invalid
 * (non-numeric or out of `0..100` range) AND `min_coverage_strict` is on.
 *
 * Distinct from {@see InvalidOpenApiSpecException} because the failure has
 * nothing to do with a spec — it's a misconfigured CI gate. A strict run
 * that opted into fail-fast must not have its gate silently disabled by a
 * typo (issue #135 review C1); bootstrap() catches this alongside
 * `InvalidOpenApiSpecException` and translates it to `exit(1)`.
 *
 * In warn-only mode the same condition is downgraded to a `WARNING` and the
 * gate is dropped, so this exception is reserved for the strict path.
