 *
 * Guard: if Pest is not present we return immediately. The library's runtime
 * stays Pest-free; the plugin activates only when a downstream consumer adds
 * `pestphp/pest` to their dev dependencies.
 *
 * Calling `expect()->extend()` outside a Pest test run is harmless — Pest
 * registers the extension globally and it sits dormant until `expect()` is
 * actually invoked. We intentionally use the procedural Pest API here rather
 * than `Pest\Plugin::uses(...)` because we are exposing custom expectations,
 * not auto-mixing traits into test files.
