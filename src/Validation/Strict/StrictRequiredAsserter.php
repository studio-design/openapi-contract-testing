 * as optional — a sign that the spec *under-describes* the implementation.
 *
 * The companion of {@see EnumDriftAsserter}:
 *  - EnumDriftAsserter: PHP enum cases vs spec `enum:` arrays (static).
 *  - StrictRequiredAsserter: runtime response body keys vs spec `required`
 *    arrays (per-test-run aggregate), walked through nested objects and
 *    array elements.
 *
 * Schema-walking helpers (path resolution, `allOf` union, disjunction
 * detection) live in {@see StrictRequiredSchemaWalker} so the per-call
 * checker can share them without duplication.
 *
 * Observations whose `(method, path, status, content-type)` does not resolve
 * to a response schema in the spec are silently skipped from drift reporting
 * — that is the coverage tracker's responsibility, not this asserter's. A
 * NOTE is emitted at run end if any such mismatches were observed so users
 * can tell "no drift" apart from "no schema to compare against".
